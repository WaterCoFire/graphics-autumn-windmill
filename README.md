# graphics-autumn-windmill

**Personal repo of assignments for DI41008 - Graphics**

A lovely Autumn Windmill implemented in OpenGL. I don't claim this is an A-grade submission!!! As it genuinely lacks creativity (and I'm clearly NOT a graphics expert). For reference only.

**NOTE: This project is compatible with both Windows 11 and macOS (Apple Silicon), but it is recommended to run it on a Mac (with Apple Silicon).**
