# graphics-autumn-windmill

**Personal repo of assignments for DI41008 - Graphics**

A lovely Autumn Windmill implemented in OpenGL. I don't claim this is an A-grade submission!!! As it genuinely lacks creativity (and I'm clearly NOT a graphics expert). For reference only.

**NOTE: This project is compatible with both Windows 11 and macOS (Apple Silicon), but it is STRONGLY recommended to run it on a Mac (with Apple Silicon).**

## Controls

A GUI control panel is available in the upper-right corner of the window to control rotation-related animations.

- Camera: W/S/A/D/Q/E to move (forward/back/left/right/down/up), camera always looks at the windmill
- Light: Arrow keys left/right/up/down for x/y, comma/period for z
- Blades rotation speed: I to increase, K to decrease
- P to pause/resume windmill main body rotation
- Windmill main body rotation speed: + to increase, - to decrease
- R to reverse all rotation directions (main body & blades)
- ESC to exit
